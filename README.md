1. LIGHT for them that sit in DARKNESS.

    _ Quest. 1. First, What this Jesus is.

    _ Quest. Secondly, What was it for Jesus to be of Davids Seed?

    _ Quest. 3. Thirdly, What it was for Jesus to be of this Mans Seed according to the Promise.

    _ Quest. Fourthly, What it was for Jesus to be raised thus up of God to Israel.

    _ Quest. 1. For the first, The Jesus in the Text, is distinguished from all others of that Name.

    _ Quest. 2. Secondly, What was it for Jesus to come into the World?

    _ Particular Testimonies, that this Coming of Jesus is his Coming to Save us.

      * The Testimony of Anna.

      * The Testimony of John Baptist.

      * The Testimony of the Star and Wise-Men.

      * The Testimony of the Angels.

      * The Testimony of God the Father.

    _ Concerning Jesus, how he put himself upon the Test among his Adversaries.

      * Quest. 3. What it was for him to come to be a Saviour.

      * Quest. 2. Secondly, What it is to come to be a Saviour?

      * Quest. 3. I come now to the Third Question, What it is for Jesus to come to be a Saviour.

    _ How Jesus Christ addressed himself to the Work of our Redemption.

    _ How he took Flesh.

    _ That it was necessary that he should take our Flesh, if he will be our Saviour.

    _ That Christ was made under the Law.

      * Quest. But some may say, What need of the

Righteousness of one that is naturally God? had Adam who was but a mean Man stood in his Innocency, and done his duty, he had saved himself and all his Posterity.

    _ Christ took upon him our Sins.

      * Quest. But how was Jesus Christ made of God to be sin for us?

      * Quest. But might not Christ die for our Sins, but he needs must bear their Guilt or Burden?

    _ He was made a Curse for us,

    _ Further Demonstration of this Truth.

      * Object. But all that die, do not bear the Curse of God for Sin.

    _ I come now to some Objections.

      * Objection First. CHrist never was a Sinner, God never supposed him to be a Sinner, neither did our Sins become really his, God never reputed him so to have been; therefore hate or punish him as a Sinner he could not; for no false judgment can belong to the Lord.

      * 2. Object. But if Christ indeed hath suffered for our Sins, and endured for them that Curse, that of justice is due thereto: then hath he also endured for us the proper torments of Hell, for they are the Wages of our Sins.

      * 3. Object. But the Scripture saith, That the Wages of Sin is everlasting punishment. Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, Mat. 25.

      * 4. Object. But the Scripture saith, Christ is our Example and that in his very death, 1 Pet. 2. 21.

      * Object. But if indeed Christ hath paid the full price for us by his Death, in suffering the Punishment that we should have done: wherefore is the Scripture so silent, as not to declare, that by his Death he hath made satisfaction?

    _ Several Demonstrations more, proving the former Doctrine.

    _ The first Demonstration.

      * Quest. But why not possible now to be helden of death?

      * Quest. But what did he do with our Sins? for he had them upon his Back.

    _ The Second Demonstration.

    _ The Third Demonstration.

    _ The Fourth Demonstration.

    _ The Fifth Demonstration.

    _ The Sixth Demonstration.

    _ The Seventh Demonstration.

    _ The Eight Demonstration.

    _ The Ninth Demonstration.

    _ The Use of the Doctrine.

      * The first Use.

      * The second Use.

Quest. But how should I prove the Goodness of mine own Righteousness, by the Death and Blood of Christ?

      * The third Use.

Object. But reason saith, since Personal Sin brought the Death, surely Personal Obedience must bring us Life and Glory.

      * The fourth use.

      * The fifth use.

      * The last Use.
